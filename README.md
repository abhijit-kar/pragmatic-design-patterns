### Objectives
1. OOP
1. Creational Patterns
1. Structural Patterns
1. Behavioral Patterns

### Cheat Sheet

#### OOP
- S - Single Responsibility
- O - Open-Closed - Open for Extension, but Closed for Modification
- L - Liskov Substitution - Child Class should be able to stand for their parents
- I - Interface Segregation - Many specific interface better than one do-it-all interface
- D - Dependency Inversion - We should program towards interface not implementation

#### Creational Patterns - Deals with Object Creation

#### Structural Patterns - Deals with Relations between Objects

#### Behavioral Patterns - Deals with Object Interaction and Responsibility
